# Tests

This project was tested using **[Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick)**, **[Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble)**, **[Nimble-Snapshots](https://github.com/ashfurrow/Nimble-Snapshots)** and  **[KIF](https://github.com/kif-framework/KIF)**

You must run the tests with the **Iphone SE simulator**, because the snapshot tests were made with it.

Make sure yout simulator is showing the keyboard, it is necessary for KIF tests
